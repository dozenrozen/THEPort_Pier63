{ "subject": "Water", "governorate": "Erbil", "question": "Is the water safe to drink from an official pipe?", "answer": "Piped water generally comes from a government system or private well/source. This varies in quality depending on the area, due to the level of suspended particles, salt or other contamination that naturally occurs so that sometimes it can be used for drinking/cooking and sometimes it can only be used for cleaning, personal hygiene and household use. If in doubt, do not drink the water unless you confirm from an official source that the water is safe to drink. Always use safe water practices (e.g. Aqua tabs, boiling, filtration) at all times. Often the best way is to follow what people in the local community do. Purchase water from official sources (such as sealed bottles of water)." },
